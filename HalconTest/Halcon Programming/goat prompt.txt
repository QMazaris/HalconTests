Create a Halcon script to follow an arbitrary edge and compare position to previously found edge. The first image: C:/Users/QuinnMazaris/Downloads/Image3.png and the second image is same location, Image4.png. Number of testing points must be user variable. The script should also give a final max / min difference in pixels between the two paths. Finally, they should be put in a window with the two overlapped. Here is the first image for reference.
